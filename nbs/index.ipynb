    "1. Transform all CNNs into an unified framework, where the model architectures are expressed by DAGs, and the nodes in DAGs represent convolution operations, the edges represent data flows from predecessor nodes to successor nodes.\n",
    "2. evaluated that the structural features of neural networks strongly influence the performance of them, and there exist several optimized structural features with better performance.\n",
    "3. automatically search optimized architectures."
